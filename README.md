## About me

  Hello! I'm Chipo Manda, a Bioinformatics MSc student at Stellenbosch University.
  I'm new to the world of coding but I'm passionate about learning and excited to explore the possibilities of Bioinformatics.
  With a background in Biomedical sciences, I'm captivated by the fusion of biology and code. 
  My current project focuses on optimizing pipelines for Mycobacterium Tuberculosis research. 
  When I'm not wrangling RNA-seq data, I'm tinkering with Python and exploring the wonders of open-source projects.
  This is my little corner of GitHub where I'll be documenting my progress and showcasing my projects.  
  Feel free to reach out and connect!
